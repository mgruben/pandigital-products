# pandigital-products 
Find the sum of all products whose factors, concatenated with the product, is 1-9 pandigital.

An n-digit number is pandigital if that number contains the digits 1 through n exactly once, in any order.  
* Ex. `321789654` is pandigital, since it contains `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9`, and is `9` digits.

A number is unusual if there is some factorization of that number which, when concatenated with the product, is pandigital.  
* Ex. `7254` is unusual, since `39 x 186 = 7254`, and `391867254` is pandigital.

If a number can be pandigital in more than one factorization, that number is still only counted once.

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
